# Introduction

This is an extension created mostly for my needs. The extension grabs all `img` tags from the active tab, the one you are currently viewing, copies their URLs, downloads them, and then create an archive file of those files.

## How to use

Just click on **Grab Images!** and it will search the page with all `img` tagged elements and copy their URLs.

## Status

At the moment, it can only copy the URLs of the images. I am working on the download part.
